		// and check Cobra's behavior directly. This test remains as a basic check.
		// For now, simply calling main() isn't feasible due to os.Exit.
		// We rely on the fact that `go build` succeeds and `Execute()` setup is sound.
		// A more involved test could use a custom command runner or test Execute directly.
