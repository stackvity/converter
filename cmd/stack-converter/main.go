// and executes the root Cobra command.

	// Execute initializes and runs the Cobra CLI application.
	// It handles command parsing, flag handling, configuration loading,
	// context setup, and invoking the main application logic.
	// Error handling (printing errors and setting exit code) is managed
	// within Cobra's Execute pattern based on the error returned by RunE functions.
